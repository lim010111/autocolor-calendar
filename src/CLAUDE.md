# Backend Module — Operational Rules (autocolor backend)

This module runs as the Cloudflare Worker `autocolor-{dev,prod}`, backed by
Supabase (PostgreSQL). The rules below are non-obvious invariants
that you must not break when extending this directory. They supersede general
style advice; see `@docs/architecture-guidelines.md` for cross-cutting rules.

## Tenant isolation

RLS policies exist on every table (`drizzle/0001_rls.sql`) but **they do not
protect the Worker path**. The Worker connects through Hyperdrive → Supabase
pooler as the `postgres` role, which has `BYPASSRLS`. The policies are
defense-in-depth for Studio / future `supabase-js` clients.

Every query that touches user-scoped data **must** include
`where(eq(table.user_id, ctx.userId))` — or the equivalent compound key for
tables keyed on `(user_id, ...)`. Never rely on "RLS will catch it."

## DB connectivity

- Runtime path: Hono → `getDb(c.env)` → postgres.js against
  `env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString`. The Worker never sees the origin DB
  credentials — those live in the Hyperdrive config.
- Pool settings (`prepare: false`, `max: 1`, `idle_timeout: 0`,
  `fetch_types: false`) are deliberate: postgres.js's defaults burn through
  the Worker subrequest budget during the Supabase pooler handshake, and
  `prepare: false` is mandatory because Supabase's pooler disallows server-
  prepared statements. Don't raise `max` or enable prepares without re-
  testing `/me` and `/oauth/google/callback` under load.
- Always wrap DB work in `try { ... } finally { c.executionCtx.waitUntil(close()); }`
  so the socket is released after the response.
- Migrations run locally with `pnpm db:migrate`, using
  `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` from `.dev.vars` (Supabase Session Pooler, port 5432,
  IPv4). Never inject `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` as a Worker secret.

## GAS deployment URL must stay stable

The Worker redirects OAuth results to `env.GAS_REDIRECT_URL`, which points at
the GAS web app `/exec`. Do not create a **new** deployment for GAS code
changes — it mints a fresh `/exec` URL and every Worker secret / GCP
authorized redirect / Script Property needs rewiring.

Instead: **GAS editor → Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil/edit on the
existing deployment → Version: "New version" → Deploy**. This publishes the
code under the same `/exec` URL.

## Secret rotation impact

- `SESSION_PEPPER`: all `sessions.token_hash` values become unverifiable →
  every logged-in user is logged out on next request. Expect a re-auth spike;
  schedule rotation outside peak hours.
- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: every `oauth_tokens.encrypted_refresh_token` row
  stops decrypting. A full re-encryption batch is required (iterate rows,
  decrypt with the old key, encrypt with the new one, bump `token_version`).
  The batch job is a Section 6 (observability) deliverable — do **not** rotate
  this key before that job exists.
- `SESSION_HMAC_KEY`: in-flight OAuth state values fail verification → only
  users mid-login are affected; existing sessions keep working.
- Supabase DB password: update the Hyperdrive origin via
  `wrangler hyperdrive update <id> --connection-string=...`. The Worker
  reconnects on next request.

## Log redaction contract

`src/middleware/logger.ts` redacts these field names when they appear as
**query-string parameters** before emitting each JSON log line:

`authorization`, `token`, `code`, `state`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`,
`id_token`, `email`, `sub`, `password`

The middleware deliberately does not read or log request/response bodies —
that keeps refresh tokens, opaque session tokens, and PII out of the log
stream by construction. If a future route needs body-level diagnostics, add
a body-scoped redactor that covers the same field set and keep the response
body out of the log. Request headers are also excluded because `Authorization:
Bearer …` tokens would otherwise be captured.

**Calendar event payloads (§4+) must never be logged.** The sync consumer
(`src/queues/syncConsumer.ts`) and `src/services/calendarSync.ts` receive
raw `events.list` responses whose `summary`, `description`, `location`,
`attendees`, `creator`, and `organizer` fields are PII. Log only aggregate
counters (`SyncSummary`) and event IDs/status. Error messages from
`CalendarApiError` are built to include only `status`/`reason`/op name, never
the response body. `sync_failures.error_body` stores Google's API error
envelope only — never the event payload that triggered the failure.

## Color ownership marker (§5.4)

When the sync pipeline PATCHes an event color (`src/services/calendarSync.ts`
→ `patchEventColor` in `src/services/googleCalendar.ts`), it writes three keys
under `extendedProperties.private`. Constants live at the top of
`googleCalendar.ts` as `AUTOCOLOR_KEYS` / `AUTOCOLOR_MARKER_VERSION` —
**reference the constants, never the literal strings**:

- `autocolor_v` — schema version. Currently `"1"`. Bump only when the
  meaning of the other keys changes; readers should treat unknown versions
  as opaque (skip rather than misinterpret).
- `autocolor_color` — the colorId this code wrote at the time of PATCH.
  This is the **ownership probe**: on the next sync, if the event's
  `colorId` no longer equals this value, the user changed it after us and
  we must treat the event as manual.
- `autocolor_category` — the categoryId that drove the color choice.
  Read by the rule-deletion rollback (`src/services/colorRollback.ts`):
  `DELETE /api/categories/:id` enqueues one `color_rollback` queue job
  per calendar in `sync_state`, and the consumer filters
  `events.list` with `privateExtendedProperty=autocolor_category=<id>`
  before PATCHing `colorId: null` + three `null` markers on events that
  pass the §5.4 ownership check (marker color still equals current
  color). **Rollback policy:** deleted-rule events revert to Google's
  default color, not to a user's pre-app original. Restoring an
  arbitrary original color would require a fourth key
  (e.g. `autocolor_prev_color`) that §5.4 deliberately does not
  capture. If product later wants true original-color restore, the
  rollback path must add that key and accept that events colored before
  the change cannot be perfectly restored.

### Concurrent PATCH race

If two devices / a webhook delivery race against an in-flight sync, the
last writer wins. This is intentional: Google's `events.patch` exposes
no `If-Match` ETag flow on `colorId`, and the next sync will re-evaluate
either way (idempotent reconciliation). Do **not** add optimistic
concurrency for this — observed-not-prevented is the correct policy.
Brief flicker between writers is benign and self-heals on the next
incremental sync.

Google's `events.patch` merges `extendedProperties.private` per-key —
other apps' keys on the same event are preserved. Conversely, **never write
a key under the `autocolor_*` prefix from any other code path** without
bumping `autocolor_v`; doing so would silently corrupt ownership decisions
on the next sync. If a future migration needs to change marker semantics,
add a new schema version (`"2"`), update the reader to switch on version,
and write a one-shot job to upgrade existing events.

`extendedProperties.private` is **app metadata, not user PII** — it is
never logged anyway (calendar event payloads are excluded from logs by the
contract above), but it would be safe to include in error messages if a
future debug path needed it. The PII redactor for the LLM leg
(`src/services/piiRedactor.ts`) does not touch this field because the LLM
prompt builder whitelists only `summary`/`description`/`location` (§5.3).

## Observability tables (§6 Wave A)

Three storage surfaces landed together so dashboards and runbooks have data to
read once they ship. No UI / rollup endpoints in this wave — schema + writers
only.

### `sync_failures.summary_snapshot` + `sync_state.last_failure_summary`

DLQ rows now carry the `SyncSummary` of the last failed attempt. Flow:

1. `applyResult` (syncConsumer) writes `result.summary` to
   `sync_state.last_failure_summary` on every retryable failure alongside
   `lastError` / `lastErrorAt`.
2. Successful sync runs (`calendarSync.runPagedList`) clear
   `last_failure_summary: null` in the same UPDATE that stamps
   `last_run_summary` — both the full-sync-complete branch and the mid-chunk
   branch. Missing the clear would leave a stale snapshot for an unrelated
   future DLQ landing.
3. When a retried message finally dies, `handleDlqBatch` SELECTs
   `last_failure_summary` for the (user, calendar) pair and copies it into
   `sync_failures.summary_snapshot`. Absent row or SELECT error → `null`
   snapshot; we never drop the DLQ audit row over a failed snapshot read.

The summary is **aggregate counters only** — no Calendar event content — so
this field respects the calendar-event-payload logging ban.

### `llm_calls`

Per-call LLM telemetry promoted from the four `SyncSummary.llm_*` counters.
Written as a single bulk INSERT at sync-run end, not per event:

- `classifyWithLlm` emits one `LlmCallRecord` via `deps.onCall` before every
  return (all outcomes covered by a `finish()` helper — adding a new outcome
  without routing through `finish()` would silently drop a row).
- `classifierChain` forwards the record to its own `onLlmCall` callback and
  synthesizes a record for the quota-latched short-circuit path
  (`latencyMs: 0`, `attempts: 0`) so "we wanted to call the model" is still
  observable.
- `runPagedList` buffers records into a per-run array; on the way out — via
  a `try { ... } finally { flushLlmCalls() }` that wraps the entire body —
  it calls `ctx.recordLlmCalls?.(buffer)` exactly once. Every return path
  (success, retryable, reauth, forbidden, not_found, full_sync_required)
  flows through the finally, so the record stream is never lost on early
  failures.
- `syncConsumer.handleOne` injects the hook with
  `execCtx.waitUntil(db.insert(llmCalls).values(rows).catch(warn))` —
  fire-and-forget so response latency is unaffected, and a DB write failure
  only downgrades to a warn log. **Observability writes must never cause
  the sync itself to retry.**

PII stance: `category_name` is the user's own category name (not PII).
`outcome`, `latency_ms`, `category_count`, `attempts`, `http_status` are pure
telemetry. No event content crosses this boundary — the whitelist in
`buildPrompt` and the `redactEventForLlm` call happen upstream of the record
emission.

### `rollback_runs`

`color_rollback` queue job audit log. Written by `applyRollbackResult` before
`msg.ack` / `msg.retry`. **All outcomes** (`ok` / `reauth_required` /
`forbidden` / `not_found` / `retryable`) insert a row with `attempt =
msg.attempts`, so a "retry then DLQ" sequence is visible as multiple rows
with increasing attempt numbers. Same error-isolation discipline as
`llm_calls`: insert errors land in a warn log and **never trigger
`msg.retry`**, because a retried rollback re-issues `clearEventColor`
PATCHes on already-cleared events and costs Google API quota.

`category_id` deliberately has no FK — the trigger for a rollback is the
category being deleted, so the target is already gone by write time.
`error_message` carries only the Google API error shape
(`status/reason/op`), consistent with the `sync_failures.error_body`
contract.

## Observability tables (§6 Wave B)

### `sync_runs`

Reader-source for `/api/stats` weekly rollups. Without this table, only the
inline `sync_state.last_run_summary` (one row per (user, calendar)) would
exist and any windowed aggregate would collapse to "the last run's numbers."

- Writer path: `calendarSync.runPagedList` owns a local `finalize(result)`
  helper that every `return` statement is required to pass through. The
  helper stamps `finished_at` if not already set, derives the `outcome`
  (`ok` when `result.ok === true`, else `result.reason`), and invokes
  `ctx.recordSyncRun?.(record)` exactly once per Worker invocation. Adding
  a new early-return path without routing through `finalize` silently drops
  an observability row — `calendarSync.test.ts`'s "§6 Wave B finalize
  routes all outcomes" suite pins the invariant by exercising each of the
  six outcome branches.
- Consumer wiring: `syncConsumer.handleOne` injects `recordSyncRun: (rec)
  => execCtx.waitUntil(db.insert(syncRuns).values(...).catch(warn))`. Same
  fire-and-forget / error-isolation discipline as `llm_calls` and
  `rollback_runs`: an insert failure lands at warn and **never** triggers
  `msg.retry`. A retried sync would re-issue `events.list` + `events.patch`
  against Google, costing API quota and risking duplicate side-effects —
  telemetry must not drive that loop.
- **Multi-row semantics**: because `handleOne` processes one Queue message
  per call, a "retry → retry → DLQ" sequence produces N `sync_runs` rows
  (Queue owns the `attempts` counter, not this table). A chunked
  `full_resync` that terminates via `MAX_PAGES_PER_FULL_RESYNC_RUN` also
  produces one row per Worker invocation — so a single logical "full
  resync arc" can appear as several rows. Dashboards that want "unique
  syncs" must aggregate on `(user_id, calendar_id, started_at)` or filter
  `outcome = 'ok' AND stored_next_sync_token = true`.
- **Duplication with `sync_state.last_run_summary` is intentional**. The
  inline column still feeds `/me` and stays as the "what did the most
  recent run do" snapshot; `sync_runs` is the append-only history. Removing
  the inline column would reshape the `/me` response and break GAS client
  parsing — scoped to a separate cleanup PR.

PII stance: counters only. The `SyncSummary` type is aggregate-by-
construction (see `calendarSync.ts`), so no event content reaches this
table. Respects the calendar-event-payload logging ban above.

Retention: no TTL in Wave B. The `(user_id, finished_at)` btree keeps
recent-window reads fast, but `sync_runs` grows monotonically. A pg_cron
purge lands with the §3-후속 "세션 GC" job.

## Preview LLM (§5 후속)

`POST /api/classify/preview` accepts an optional `{ llm: true }` body flag.
When set, rule-miss events are forwarded through the same
`buildDefaultClassifier` closure the sync pipeline uses, so:

- Per-user daily quota (`llm_usage_daily` via `reserveLlmCall`) is **shared**
  with the sync path — there is no separate preview cap. A sync burst that
  exhausts quota immediately blocks preview too, and vice versa.
- Per-call telemetry lands in `llm_calls` via the same record shape. Writer
  location differs — sync's `runPagedList` does a bulk insert at run end,
  preview does a one-row `execCtx.waitUntil(db.insert(llmCalls).values(...).catch(warn))`
  inside the route handler finally. Same fire-and-forget / error-isolation
  discipline: a DB write failure downgrades to a warn log and never blocks
  the response, because the preview path has no Queue message to retry.
- `classifierChain`'s internal quota-latch path is a **dead branch** in
  preview. The latch matters only for ≥2 rule-miss events sharing a single
  factory closure; preview builds a fresh closure per request. If a future
  refactor reuses the closure across requests (e.g. an LRU cache), the
  latch's state-leak potential must be reconsidered.
- Rule hits short-circuit inside the chain before the LLM leg runs — the
  `llm: true` flag does not suppress rule evaluation, and rule-hit responses
  retain the existing `source: "rule"` shape (regression-guarded by
  `classifyRoute.test.ts`'s "rule hit via chain" case).
- Preview is triggered by an explicit GAS button (`actionClassifyWithLlm`),
  which throttles user-initiated invocations socially. A dedicated preview
  rate limit is deferred to §6.4 후속.

Response shape additions: `source: "llm"` for LLM hits (no
`matchedKeyword`); `llmTried: true` on `source: "no_match"` when the chain
engaged the LLM leg (key present + categories ≥ 1 + reached `onLlmAttempted`).
Callers that are `llm: false` / omit the flag see the pre-existing three
shapes only — the new shapes are opt-in and backwards-compatible.

## Manual-trigger rate limit (§6.4)

`sync_state.last_manual_trigger_at` is the **sole writer** for the 30-second
`POST /sync/run` coalesce window. Only `src/routes/sync.ts`'s `/sync/run`
handler stamps it, and only **after** a successful `enqueueSync` — an
enqueue failure must not punish the user with a 30s lockout.

**The consumer must never write this column.** Pre-§6.4 the rate limit read
`sync_state.updated_at`, but the consumer's own claim / release / summary /
`last_error` writes all touch `updated_at`, so a sync that just completed
would keep the window shut and 429 the user when they added a rule and
re-triggered immediately (§4A Finding #7). Splitting this column out was
the fix; if a future consumer path starts writing `last_manual_trigger_at`,
the bug returns silently and the `syncRoute.test.ts` §6.4 suite won't catch
it (those tests exercise the route layer, not the consumer).

**NULL semantics / backfill**: pre-migration rows land with `NULL`. The
route falls back to `updated_at` in that case — old behavior preserved
until the first post-deploy manual trigger stamps the column. No backfill
job: NULL is the correct "no manual trigger observed in this column's
lifetime" signal, and the fallback makes it indistinguishable from the
pre-split behavior for affected rows.

**Atomicity**: the SELECT and UPDATE are not wrapped in a transaction.
Two concurrent `/sync/run` requests can both read a stale
`last_manual_trigger_at`, both pass the rate-limit check, and both enqueue.
This is intentional — button-spam absorption, not hard rate limiting — and
the consumer's `in_progress_at` claim serialises actual sync work
regardless. Do not upgrade this to `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or a conditional
UPDATE; the extra round-trip costs more than duplicate incremental jobs
(which the sync-token consumer absorbs idempotently).

## Watch renewal concurrency (§6.4 / §4B M4)

`sync_state.watch_renewal_in_progress_at` is the per-row claim column for the
Google Calendar watch-channel renewal job. Mirrors the claim-with-staleness
pattern of `in_progress_at` (sync consumer) and `last_manual_trigger_at`
(manual-trigger rate limit), but is intentionally **separate from both**.

**Sole writer** is `src/services/watchRenewal.ts`'s per-row loop, via
`claimWatchRenewal` / `releaseWatchRenewal` in `src/lib/watchClaim.ts`. Any
future manual-trigger route (e.g. `/admin/watch/renew` once §6.3 Wave B lands
the admin surface) **must route through the same helpers** — adding a second
writer to this column would re-open the race this work closed.

**The sync consumer must never touch this column.** `sync_state.in_progress_at`
(owned by `syncClaim.ts`) already holds the sync claim. Sync (events.list +
events.patch) and renewal (channels.stop + channels.watch) act on independent
Google API surfaces, so collapsing them into one lock would pointlessly
serialise two workloads with no data-race justification and could starve
renewal for a heavily-syncing user (worst case: slipping past the 7-day watch
expiry boundary).

**TTL is 10 minutes**, longer than syncClaim's 5-minute window. `channels.stop`
+ `channels.watch` plus a 429 retry can legitimately run for tens of seconds,
and renewal fires only from cron (not a user-visible request path), so the
latency tradeoff is different. If the original worker hangs, a second worker
can take over after 10 minutes; `channels.stop` absorbs 404 and the next cron
tick converges any transient double-register — same "observed, not prevented"
policy as the concurrent PATCH race in §5.4.

**Millisecond-precision ownership probe** (`date_trunc('milliseconds', now())`)
is preserved from `syncClaim.ts`: without it, the Postgres µs → JS `Date` ms
round-trip would silently no-op every release's ownership check and leave the
lock held until the 10-min stale window expires. Pinned behaviorally in
`watchRenewal.test.ts` case 1 (release receives the exact `claimedAt` reference
back from claim) and source-level via a regex guard (same form as the
`syncClaim` precision invariant).

**NULL semantics**: pre-migration rows land with `NULL`. The first claim
stamps the column atomically; a crashed worker's abandoned non-NULL value
auto-heals via the 10-min stale window. No backfill job.

**Atomicity**: the per-row UPDATE is a single-statement atomic
`UPDATE ... WHERE (NULL OR lt(now() - interval)) ... RETURNING`; two concurrent
workers racing on the same row will see exactly one succeed. The loser sees
`acquired: false` and skips. `continue` in the renewal loop lives **outside**
the `try { ... } finally { release }` block specifically so a skipped row
does not trigger a spurious release (which would no-op via the ownership guard
anyway, but avoiding the DB round-trip keeps the observable behavior clean).

## Environments

- `dev`: `autocolor-dev` Worker, `autocolor-dev-db` Hyperdrive, full secrets.
- `prod`: `autocolor-prod` Worker is a **URL-reserving shell**. It has
  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` configured and answers `/healthz`, but has no
  secrets, no Hyperdrive binding, and no Supabase project yet. `/oauth/*`,
  `/me`, `/auth/logout` will fail until a prod Supabase project, GCP OAuth
  client, and secret bootstrap are added (separate task).
